### Overview of Final project for dats-6103

Our goal for this project is to utilize data mining techniques and algorithms to analyze the physical properties of the Great Lakes. Specifically, we aimed to answer the following questions: 

## Key Questions

1. Based on surface temperature, can we build a model to predict whether each of the Great Lakes reach maximum ice coverage with respect to maximum ice cover average threshold?
    - We achieved this through a logistic regression model. 

2. Based on surface temperature, ice concentration, and physical properties, can we build a model to predict which lake a set of characteristics most likely belongs to?   
    - We achieved this through a KNN model that clusters characterists by lake.
